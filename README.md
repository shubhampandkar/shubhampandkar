# Shubham Rajan Pandkar - Projects Portfolio

## Index

This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've worked on. Currently they're binned in two different categories

1. [Personal Programming Projects (Python - Data Science)](https://github.com/shubhampandkar/shubhampandkar/tree/main/Personal%20Programming%20Projects)
2. Public Tableau Visualizations

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.

## Background

Hello!

My name is Darwin Agunos and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. 
I did my undergraduate at Cal Poly Pomona where I majored in Physics with an emphasis on applications computational sciences. 
In my undergraduate studies I was a Physics Education Researcher where I spent my time analyzing the effectiveness of certain instructional 
pedagogies on student performance, sentiment analysis on students perceptions of the physics-math intersection in quantum mechanics and 
the analysis of how demographics affect student performance (e.g. gender/racial gaps in student performance).

Now I focus on programming for whatever problems come my way, automating my life wherever I can and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
