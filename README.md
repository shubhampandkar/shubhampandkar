# Shubham Rajan Pandkar - Projects Portfolio

## Index

This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've worked on. Currently they're binned in two different categories

1. [Personal Programming Projects (Python - Data Science)](https://github.com/shubhampandkar/shubhampandkar/tree/main/Personal%20Programming%20Projects)
2. Public Tableau Visualizations

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.

## Background

Hello!

My name is Shubham Pandkar and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little bit about me. 
I am a Graduate student at New Jersey Institute of Technology where I major in Data Science. 
I have 2.5 years of experience working as a Mainframe developer at Infosys Ltd, India.
Currently I am working as a Software Engineer in Machine Learning Intern at Tango Consulting Inc.


Now I focus on programming for whatever problems come my way, automating my life wherever I can and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
